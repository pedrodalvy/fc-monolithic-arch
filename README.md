# Monolithic Architecture: Tactical Modeling and Patterns

[![codecov][codecov-image]][codecov-url]
[![Quality Gate Status][sonar-image]][sonar-url]

This project is a practical implementation of Monolithic Architecture concepts using TypeScript. It serves as a
companion project for learning TypeScript and Monolithic Architecture principles through hands-on coding exercises. By
following this project, you'll gain a better understanding of how to structure your codebase, separate concerns, and
build maintainable and scalable applications using TypeScript and Monolithic Architecture.

> Note: This project was developed to be used as a learning tool in conjunction with
> **[Full Cycle's](https://fullcycle.com.br) "Sistemas monolÃ­ticos"** course. It does not represent a production-ready
> application and is focused on educational purposes only.
